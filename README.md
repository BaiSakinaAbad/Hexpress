# Hexpress
Midterm Project for for Design and Analysis of Algorithm
&emsp; &ensp; 
Hexpress is a delivery service inspired by the Studio Ghibli Film Kiki's Delivery Service.
Our program combines the beautiful aesthetic of the world of Kiki's Delivery Service with the power of Computer Science to create this project. <br>

## How to Install the Program?
+ Begin by downloading and extracting the given zip folder containing the program files
+ Find and Run the **WelcomeUI** class. <br>

## Knapsack Algorithm
+ The program will firstly display all of the pre defined product list that will be passed to the Knapsack Algorithm.
+ The User will be prompt to enter the maximum capacity of the basket that Kiki will hold.
+ The Knapsack Algorithm will calculate all the possible product combination and will choose the combination with the highest value to be delivered first.

## Sorting Algorithm
+ Based on the result of the Knapsack algorithm, which evaluates all possible combinations of products, this part of the program presents various options to sort the list, such as:
  + **By name**
  + **By value**
  + **By weight**

## Traveling Salesman Problem Algorithm(TSP)
+ The program will display the map that is used
+ The TSP delivery routes based on the best combination chosen by the Knapsack will run through a simulation
+ The simulation will display the routes that Kiki will follow

## String Matching Algorithm
+ By using the cutomer name, location and other values in the product table, the program can retrieve the right customer name, location and their order by using string matching
+ This is implemented using a search based UI design

## Exit
+ Once the user is satistfied with the output of the program, the exit button will display the programmer's names
